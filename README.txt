To run the final program run the exe in relative path '\out\build\conwaypreset\bin\conway.exe'
I added supporting dlls in the folder to ensure the libraries are present.
resources are in 'out\build\conwaypreset\resources\', which should not be changed as the code uses relative paths as well.


As of 23/11/2024, this project builds and runs perfectly on both my and Harris's computers. Will attach a video file showing the working project on LMS.


This is part of the source code. The build output will be submitted in a separate zip with all dlls and resources. So, just extract and run.
