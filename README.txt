To run the final program run the exe in relative path '\out\build\conwaypreset\bin\conway.exe'
I added supporting dlls in the folder to ensure the libraries are present.
resources are in 'out\build\conwaypreset\resources\', which should not be changed as the code uses relative paths as well.

This project was part of a LUMS CS101 course's final submission for Fall 2024.
